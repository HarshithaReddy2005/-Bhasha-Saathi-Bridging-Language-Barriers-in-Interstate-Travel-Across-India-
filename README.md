## 🧠 1.1 Problem Being Solved

India embraces numerous linguistic and cultural traditions, which—while enriching—pose significant challenges for interstate travelers. A person from Telangana visiting Tamil Nadu or Karnataka may face great difficulty understanding or communicating in the local language.

This challenge affects a wide range of people including migrant workers, students, and older adults. In our AI-dominated era, not everyone has access to smartphones, the internet, or the ability to use digital tools that require English proficiency.

Language barriers become especially dangerous in emergencies, making people feel helpless and unsafe. The problem is not just technical—it is a **human rights issue**, where every person deserves the ability to communicate and receive help when needed.
